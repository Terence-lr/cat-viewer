The Random Cat Viewer is a simple web app that lets users see 
random cat images by clicking a button. It fetches the images from The Cat API using modern JavaScript features like async/await.
While the image is loading, a spinner appears to show that the app is working. If something goes wrong, the app displays a friendly error message. 
The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the code organized into separate files for easier management.
